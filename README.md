# Esp_WIFI
Yet Another handheld Device with WIFI Information Gathering and Some Usefull WIFI Attack 
concept Using a Low Cost Micro-Controller Like ESP32, Lets See Howfar I can go but i should 
keep in mind its for Personal and education purpose only as it will help me understand and Learn 
Concepts of WIFI and Micro-Controller, PCB Designing, Electronics, 
## SOME noteable Feature 
Most of code Already Written by lots of more capable and Intelligent people and with due respect i want to write same thing from ground up just coz either their user interface isnt suits me or i just want to and i think i can do
- Packet Monitor
- Deauther
- Packet Capture(pcap)
- Single Strength analyzer
- Handy Soft Hotspot to Enhance Other wifi range
- Capature Nearby Wifi Access point's name to SD card
- Handshake Capture
- PROBE Request sniffing
- Beacon Spamming
- Fully Automatic WIFI Phishing Kind a Attack to trick user to get Password 
## Feature am Thinking i should or not 
- IR BruteForce/ IR Cloning
- A Atmosphese Data Gathering (Temp/humidity/Pressure)
## Phishing 
For fully Phishing kind a Attack am Planning to Use ESP8266 as Secondary Micro-Controller to achive Some its capability to Send De-Auth packets And also some 
Automation to Verify and all 
## Hardware am Using At this Stage 
- ESP32 (Ai-TInker Esp32 Wroom DEV board)
- ST7735 128x160 1.8" TFT
- 7 Push Buttons (5 in use to Interface with UI, 2 Buttons Will Available for future Use)
- PCB



At this Stage pls Consider mySelf as NOOB And please Please Please Correct my Mistake And make this Project all together and Consider Changes Frequently
Lets keep in touch if anyone want to help me or have some other cool idea or anyone wanna teach me i would love to learn thing related to this Project of my 
all code will available here for this community
