## About this Project 👋
Yet Another handheld Device with WIFI Information Gathering and Some Tricks.
Main purpose of this Project is just to Get Better At Programming in general and Get familier with Esp/Arduino Micro-Controller.
At this stage pls consider mySelf as NOOB and please correct my mistake and make this Project all together and consider changes frequently
Lets keep in touch if anyone want to help me or have some other cool idea or anyone wanna teach me i would love to learn thing related to this projects

      - Their is StatusBar UI element on a color and that StatusBar is used to show page name and also ther is a Element to show          free heap memory available
        and as status is in a spefic color i want and this statusBar is A rountRect element on TFT and i want to change or Update         color of this statusBar according
        to bettery level.
(Issue am facing as of now how to get Bettery Level and am just aware of Voltage Divider but but i think voltage Divider Circuit Consume Power just for this reason,i discarded this approach and if anyone has any bettery way to measure voltage please let me know)
